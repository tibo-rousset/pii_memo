# Repository for Final Project of COMP545 


For starting off this project we use as a starting off point the repository of the paper "Demystifying Verbatim Memorization in Large Language Models" found [here](https://github.com/explanare/verbatim-memorization?tab=MIT-1-ov-file)

To generate our pii containing sequences to inject we utilize the scripts under injection_data_gen/

Under activation-patching/ is the Jupyter notebook and related config used to run our activation patching experiments
